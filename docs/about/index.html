<h3>How to apply</h3>
<p> The Academy of Sport continues to thrive. The high demand for places, and the extremely high standard of applicants
    is indicative of the increasing awareness in the local community of what the Academy has to offer. However pure
    sporting ability is not the only criteria for selection. There must be recognition from students that they
    demonstrate behaviours and attributes that align to Westlake’s culture, and also uphold standards of academic
    effort and focus in all subjects.

    All intermediate school students entering high school whether in or out of zone who wish to perform at an elite
    level are encouraged to apply – a separate application form must be completed during the enrolment process.</p>

    <p>People think focus means saying yes to the thing you’ve got to focus on. But that’s not what it means at
        all. It means saying no to the hundred other good ideas that there are. You have to pick carefully. I’m
        actually as
        proud of the things we haven’t done as the things I have done. Innovation is saying no to 1,000 things.</p>
