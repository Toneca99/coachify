        <p>
            Almost 250 runners in a half marathon were caught cheating when traffic cameras captured them taking
            shortcuts
            through bushes.
        </p>
        <p>
            Organisers of the race in Shenzhen, China, also discovered 18 runners wearing fake bibs and three runners
            they
            described as "imposters".
        </p>
        <p>
            All who cheated are now facing bans.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Marathon running is not simply exercise, it is a metaphor for life, and every runner is responsible for
            him or
            herself," organisers said.

                Footage captured by Shenzhen police traffic cameras showed runners cutting through bushes to an
                adjacent
                carriageway, instead of continuing along the road and making a U-turn.
            </p>
            <p>
                Organisers said the 237 people caught cheating would have run two or three kilometres less than the
                full
                21-kilometre (13.1-mile) distance.
            </p>

            <p>
                The annual race in China's fourth largest city typically attracts about 16,000 runners.

            </ul>
            <p>
                News of the cheating led to the People's Daily newspaper - one of China's biggest publications - to
                urge
                runners to "respect the marathon and respect sporting spirit" in an editorial.
            </p>
            <p>
                Last year, organisers of the Beijing Half Marathon introduced a facial recognition system to stop
                runners using
                ringers to run on their behalf.
            </p>
            <p>
                China has held 1,072 marathons and other road races this year, up from 22 in 2011, according to figures
                from
                the Chinese Athletics Association.
